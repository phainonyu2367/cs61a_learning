## The Game

A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food, or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of a tunnel (you lose), or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win).

### Core concepts

**The Colony**. This is where the game takes place. The colony consists of several _places_ that are chained together to form a tunnel where bees can travel through. The colony has some quantity of food that can be expended to deploy ant troops.

**Places**. A place links to another place to form a tunnel. The player can place a single ant into each place. However, there can be many bees in a single place.

**The Hive**. This is the place where bees originate. Bees exit the beehive to enter the ant colony.

**Ants**. Ants are the usable troops in the game that the player places into the colony. Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different amount of food to place. The two most basic ant types are the `HarvesterAnt`, which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the `ThrowerAnt`, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn. You will be implementing many more.

**Bees**. Bees are the antagonistic troops in the game that the player must defend the colony from. Each turn, a bee either advances to the next place in the tunnel if no ant is in its way, or it stings the ant in its way. Bees win when at least one bee reaches the end of a tunnel.

### Core classes

The concepts described above each have a corresponding class that encapsulates the logic for that concept. Here is a summary of the main classes involved in this game:

- `GameState`: Represents the colony and some state information about the game, including how much food is available, how much time has elapsed, where the `QueenAnt` resides, and all the `Place`s in the game.
- `Place`: Represents a single place that holds insects. At most one `Ant` can be in a single place, but there can be many `Bee`s in a single place. `Place` objects have an `exit` to the left and an `entrance` to the right which are also places. Bees travel through a tunnel by moving to a `Place`'s `exit`.
- `Hive`: Represents the place where `Bee`s start out (on the right of the tunnel).
- `AntHomeBase`: Represents the place `Ant`s are defending (on the left of the tunnel). If Bees get here, they win :(
- `Insect`: A superclass for `Ant` and `Bee`. All insects have an `armor` attribute, representing their remaining health, and a `place` attribute, representing the `Place` where they are currently located. Each turn, every active `Insect` in the game performs its `action`.
- `Ant`: Represents ants. Each `Ant` subclass has special attributes or a special `action` that distinguish it from other `Ant` types. For example, a `HarvesterAnt` gets food for the colony and a `ThrowerAnt` attacks `Bee`s. Each ant type also has a `food_cost` attribute that indicates how much it costs to deploy one unit of that type of ant.
- `Bee`: Represents bees. Each turn, a bee either moves to the `exit` of its current `Place` if no ant blocks its path, or stings an ant that blocks its path.
